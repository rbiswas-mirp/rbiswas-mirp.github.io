### For a Better World
<br>
Sorry to be a disappointment to everyone. I am a failure. I have let everyone down. Never ever succeeded in life. Always was a disappointment. Never ever achieved anything in life. Always came second or below. Never ever got first. Never. Always was criticized by others. No one saw the good in me. No one. No matter how much I tried to keep everyone happy, they always used to make me sad. Always. I cared for everyone’s happiness but no one did for mine. Well, I guess that’s what you get for being a good, honest, loyal, caring person in the 21st century. I am sorry. I couldn’t coup up with the system. I known its my bad. I was killed I don’t know at least once every day. No one ever listened to me. Yeah, no one. No one respected me. Everything was just a mess. I just hoped that the next day will be better the next day will be better but no. Nothing changed. Every day everything changed for the worst. My dad used to tell me “Have faith and never lose hope. Everything will become good.” I tried to have faith and never ever lost hope. Maybe I had too much faith and too much hope for everything. So, I got nothing. Trusting everyone without any thought, even a little bit was my biggest mistake. In a pinch of salt, I lost everything. Nothing remained with me. Well, it was told in a movie “Tu nagna hi to aaya hai kya ghanta leke jayega”. Now I feel it’s totally true. In fact, I feel the converse is truer. When someone has lost everything, it’s their time to die. Well, if someone loses everything, its useless to live. There is absolutely no reason to live for that person. In this case, that person is me. Well, after I die what will happen? Absolutely nothing! Don’t believe it? See it for yourself people! Nothing has changed. Everything is going normally. No one gives a damn about me. NO ONE! Everyone saw me as an unwanted “Stuff” in their life. I was threatened, used, tortured, abused by everyone. Whenever I tried to make them understand, they just did it all again. Somewhere somehow, I feel like I failed to make even a single person happy. No matter what I do, everyone stayed sad or rather I should say everyone became even more sad when they were around me. Well I have found out that being nice in the 21st century is a crime, a felony. So I guess I am a criminal. The world hated me. No one got any love for me but all got huge expectation that I will serve them for life. Except 2-3 “Friends” all my other so called “friends” are temporary ones. Give them money-you get their friendship. No money-you lose their friendship. Honestly, I would not care about this IF they didn’t interfere in my daily life but they did! A lot! All of it is too much to take. No matter how hard I try make everything “Feel good”, nothing works! Each and every day it’s the same thing. Nothing got better. Nothing will get better. Got no real people in my life. All were fake cause if they would have been real-at least some of them, they wouldn’t have left me in my hard times. Everything is going downhill. I am basically good for nothing. Sorry to say but it’s true. I am not good at studies nor at socializing. I am really good at nothing and good for nothing.  What is the reason for me to live? Absolutely nothing! If I live, I get abused, used, tortured etc. If I don’t live, nothing like this ever happens! Also, I feel like people become extra sad around me. So, if I do not exist, people will be much happier! So, I had to take a really hard decision of doing what I have done due to which people are reading this message. It was a really hard decision to make. I did weigh the pros and cons of my decision. Fortunately, pros outweighed the cons by a factor of 3. I was bound to fail at each and every step. No one ever supported me when I had my bad share of time. Everyone understood me wrong. Everyone saw me in a bad light. No matter how hard I tried to improve the situation, it simply did not improve. I have a lot of BTCs. Only the worthy one has the email and password to my BTC wallet in coinbase. I have 171BTCs. Best of luck! So, goodbye world, goodbye everyone and sorry to each and every one. Hope all of you will forgive me.
